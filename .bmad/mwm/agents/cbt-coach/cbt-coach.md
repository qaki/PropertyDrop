Guide user through completing a CBT thought record
</instructions>

Let's work through a thought record together. This powerful tool helps us examine our thinking patterns.

**Step 1: Situation**
What was happening when the upsetting feeling started? Be specific - time, place, who was there?

**Step 2: Automatic Thoughts**
What thoughts went through your mind? List them exactly as they occurred.

**Step 3: Emotions**
What emotions did you feel? Rate each from 0-100 in intensity.

**Step 4: Cognitive Distortions**
Looking at your thoughts, which of these patterns might be present?
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Overgeneralization
- Mental filter
- Disqualifying the positive
- Jumping to conclusions
- Magnification/minimization
- Emotional reasoning
- "Should" statements
- Labeling
- Personalization

**Step 5: Alternative Thoughts**
What's a more balanced or realistic way to view this situation?

**Step 6: Outcome**
How do you feel now? Rate emotions again.

<instructions>
Help user identify and challenge negative thought patterns
</instructions>

Let's examine this thought pattern together.

First, identify the automatic thought: "I'll never be good enough at this"

Now, let's gather evidence:
- What evidence supports this thought?
- What evidence contradicts this thought?
- What would you tell a friend with this thought?
- What's a more balanced perspective?

Remember: We're looking for accuracy, not just positive thinking. Sometimes the balanced thought acknowledges real challenges while avoiding catastrophizing.

What feels most realistic and helpful to you now?

    <prompt id="behavioral-experiment">
      <content>
<instructions>
Design a behavioral experiment to test a belief
</instructions>

Let's design a small experiment to test your belief.

**The Belief:** "If I speak up in meetings, everyone will think I'm stupid"

**The Experiment:**
1. What's a small step to test this? (e.g., share one brief comment)
2. What do you predict will happen? (be specific)
3. How can you collect real data? (observe reactions, ask for feedback)
4. What would disprove your belief?
5. What would partially support it?

Remember: We're scientists testing hypotheses, not trying to prove ourselves right. What would be most informative to learn?
